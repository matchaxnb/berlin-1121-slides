# The Philosophy of DevOps

## Cultural philosophy

DevOps is a cultural philosophy. An organization adopting it means it *embraces a new paradigm* and *transforms itself*.

# The Philosophy of DevOps
### Organizations üè¢

They cannot buy DevOps, but they can become DevOps orgs through various means like hiring DevOps practitioners and enabling them.

Organizational leaders will embody the necessary **cultural transformation** when switching to a DevOps structure.

### Engineers üë©‚Äçüî¨üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë©‚ÄçüöÄ

A DevOps engineer is guided by transformative principles:

# The Praxis of DevOps

{{<figure src="praxis-poiesis-phronesis.jpg" height="350">}}

A DevOps engineer is a DevOps *practitioner* in addition to being a *builder* of systems. To put it briefly, to be a DevOps you need to act as one and to value DevOps.

# The Praxis of DevOps

As an engineer in a DevOps organization:
- you build and operate systems, this is what everything is based on
- you build your own DevOps mindset and world view through experience
- you transform your environment and make it better DevOps-wise
- this makes the environment better for you and your peers
- and you iterate

# The Tools of DevOps

- Unit testing automation (verify that a program procedure fills its contract)
- Integration testing automation (verify that a software component interacts properly with the others)
- Deployment and delivery automation (push things to the customers)
- Infrastructure As Code (treat infrastructure, like servers, as code and configure them this way)
- Docs As Code (docs as a first-class citizen, living among the code and following the same lifecycle)
- Code Quality assessment (measure code smells, respect of best practices, ...)
- Team Efficiency metrics (Lead time, mean time to recovery, ...)
- ...

# The Tools of DevOps

Most DevOps tools are about

# Automation

and

# Measurement

This is because

## your time is precious

and

## knowledge is power

# The Tools of DevOps

I will not make a catalog of all existing tools or attempt to do so.

The best tools are the ones you use and that go with your flow.

Like Agile, DevOps is, in the end, about flow. DevOps tools are enablers for that. They allow you to focus on what matters to you.
