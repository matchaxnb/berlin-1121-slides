So, what is DevOps?
- the result of applying agile methodology to a broader scope than just software development but the entire lifecycle of computer engineering
- praxis: by doing it you become better at it and you have an impact (cultural and technical) on your org and environment

What is DevOps about?
- DevOps has very much to do with the open source culture, collaboration and rapid innovation
- Focus, efficiency, doing what you're best at (your part of the value stream)
- Removing walls and abolishing silos across engineering value streams so there is less "Us" and "Them" (this is especially true for knowledge silos)

What is DevOps made of?
- Various methods and practices stemming from Agile frameworks that all endeavor to manage software lifecycle end-to-end and continuously
- Many different toolchains to assist and enable each step of the software lifecycle
- A number of philosophical positions about software lifecycle
